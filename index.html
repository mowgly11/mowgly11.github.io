      <h1 class="section-title">About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm Osama Bouzalim, a 19-year-old software developer driven by an insatiable curiosity and passion for
        all things tech. My coding journey started with the desire to understand how software works under the hood, and
        it has grown into a commitment to crafting efficient, meaningful digital experiences.
        <br><br>
        I specialize in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on creating visually appealing
        and intuitive user interfaces. On the back-end, I leverage Node.js and Bun to build robust APIs and perform
        intricate web scraping. I also use Python for scripting, automation, and data manipulation, taking advantage of
        its powerful libraries to solve various challenges.
        <br><br>
        I'm currently learning more about Rust, exploring its capabilities for systems programming and high-performance
        applications. Beyond coding, my hobbies include playing cards, reading books, and working outâ€”activities that
        help me unwind, stay inspired, and maintain a balanced lifestyle.

        Feel free to explore my work, and reach out if you'd like to collaborate or discuss a project. Let's build
        something amazing together!</p>
